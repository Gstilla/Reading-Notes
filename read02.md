## Why is it important to use semantic elements in our HTML?
* It's important to use semantic elements in HTML because they provide meaning and structure to web content. 
Semantic elements help search engines and other automated tools understand the meaning and context of the content on a web page.
This can improve search engine optimization (SEO) and accessibility, making it easier for people with disabilities to use the site.
In addition, semantic elements can improve the overall organization and readability of a web page for human users.

## How many levels of headings are there in HTML?
* There are six levels of headings in HTML, ranging from h1 for the most important heading to h6 for the least important. 
Headings are used to structure content and provide hierarchy, 
with h1 being the main heading for the entire page and subsequent headings used for subsections or nested content.

## What are some uses for the sup and sub elements?
* The sup element is used to display superscript text, which is typically used for mathematical and scientific notation (e.g., exponents, footnotes). 
The sub element is used to display subscript text, which is often used in chemical formulas and mathematical equations.
These elements can also be used for other purposes, such as trademark symbols (TM) or copyright symbols (Â©).

## When using the abbr element, what attribute must be added to provide the full expansion of the term?
* When using the <abbr> element, the title attribute must be added to provide the full expansion of the term.
The title attribute specifies additional information about an element, and in the case of the <abbr> element, it is used to provide the full text of the abbreviation or acronym.
This information is typically displayed as a tooltip when the user hovers over the abbreviated term.
  
## What are ways we can apply CSS to our HTML?
* Linking an external CSS file
* Using internal CSS within the HTML document
* Using inline styles directly within HTML tags
## Why should we avoid using inline styles?
* Difficult to maintain and update styles across a large website or application
* Inline styles can override styles defined in external or internal CSS files, which can create unintended effects.
  
## Review the block of code below and answer the following questions:
  
  ### What is representing the selector?

### Which components are the CSS declarations?
  
* The CSS declarations are "color: black;" and "padding: 5px;".
  
### Which components are considered properties?
  
* The properties are "color" and "padding".
  
  
  
 ## What data type is a sequence of text enclosed in single quote marks?
* The data type is a string.
## List 4 types of JavaScript operators.
* Arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /, %)
* Assignment operators (=, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=)
* Comparison operators (==, !=, ===, !==, <, <=, >, >=)
* Logical operators (&&, ||, !)
  
## Describe a real world Problem you could solve with a Function.
* One real world problem that could be solved with a function is calculating the total cost of a purchase including taxes and any applicable discounts. 
  A function could take in the base price of the item, the tax rate, and any discount codes, and return the total cost of the item after all calculations are applied.
  This could be useful for businesses that sell products online or in-store and need to quickly calculate the final price for a customer.
  
  
  ## An if statement checks a __ and if it evaluates to ___, then the code block will execute.
* An if statement checks a condition and if it evaluates to true, then the code block will execute.
  
## What is the use of an else if?
* An else if statement allows for additional conditions to be checked after an initial if statement. 
 If the first condition is not met, the program will move on to the next else if statement to check if that condition is true. 
  If none of the else if statements evaluate to true, the program will move on to the else statement or exit the if statement entirely.
  
  ## List 3 different types of comparison operators.
* Equal to (==)
* Not equal to (!=)
* Greater than or equal to (>=)
## What is the difference between the logical operator && and ||?
* The logical operator && (and) returns true if both operands are true. Otherwise, it returns false.
* The logical operator || (or) returns true if at least one operand is true. Otherwise, it returns false.
