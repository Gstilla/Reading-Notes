HTTP is the protocol of the web

It sends data from one place to the next

Through the vast expanse of the net

In packets, it travels without rest



HTML, CSS, and JS files are parsed in the browser by the rendering engine, which interprets the code and displays it on the screen. The rendering engine parses the HTML to create the Document Object Model (DOM), which represents the content of the web page. CSS is then parsed to create the CSS Object Model (CSSOM), which represents the styling of the page. Finally, JS is parsed and executed to add interactivity and dynamic behavior to the page.


There are many ways to find images to add to a website, including:

* Using stock photo websites, such as Shutterstock or Getty Images
* Taking your own photos or creating your own graphics
* Searching for free images on websites like Unsplash or Pexels
* Using Google Images to search for images that are labeled for reuse



To create a string in JavaScript, you can enclose a series of characters in single or double quotes, like this:
javascript

let myString = 'Hello, world!';
To create a number, you can simply write a numeric value, like this:


* let myNumber = 42;
* What is a variable and why are they important in JavaScript:
* A variable in JavaScript is a container that holds a value. Variables are important because they allow you to store and manipulate data in your code. They provide a way to give a name to a value, so that you can refer to it later in your code. Variables can also be reassigned, allowing your code to be more flexible and dynamic.





1. What is an HTML attribute?

* An HTML attribute is a characteristic or property of an HTML element that provides additional information about the element. Attributes are defined within the opening tag of an HTML element and typically consist of a name-value pair. Examples of common HTML attributes include "href" for hyperlinks and "src" for image sources.

2. Describe the Anatomy of an HTMl element.
 
* An HTML element consists of an opening tag, content, and a closing tag. The opening tag is the first part of the element and identifies the type of element using angled brackets (< and >) and the element name. The content is the information or data contained within the element. Finally, the closing tag uses angled brackets and a forward slash (/) to close the element.

3. What is the Difference between <article> and <section> element tags?
  
* The <article> and <section> elements are similar in that they are both used to group related content on a web page. However, the main difference is that the <article> element is used for standalone content that can be distributed or reused independently from the rest of the page, while the <section> element is used for grouping related content together.

4. What Elements does a “typical” website include?
  
*A "typical" website may include a variety of elements, but some common ones include a header section containing a logo and navigation links, a main content area containing the primary content of the page, a footer section containing additional information or links, and various other elements such as images, videos, and forms.

5. How does metadata influence Search Engine Optimization?
  
* Metadata can influence search engine optimization (SEO) by providing additional information about the content on a web page, such as keywords, descriptions, and authorship. Search engines use this metadata to understand the content of the page and to determine how relevant it is to specific search queries. By including accurate and relevant metadata, website owners can help their pages appear more prominently in search engine results pages (SERPs).

6. How is the <meta> HTML tag used when specifying metadata?
  
* The <meta> tag is used in the head section of an HTML document to specify metadata such as the page title, description, and keywords. This information is not displayed on the page itself, but is instead used by search engines and other applications to understand and categorize the content of the page. The <meta> tag typically includes attributes such as "name", "content", and "charset" to provide additional information about the metadata being specified.
