# Class 10 Notes

## Syntax Errors vs. Logic Errors
* Syntax errors violate the rules of the programming language
* Logic errors occur when code doesn't produce the expected result
* Syntax errors are usually easy to fix, while logic errors require more investigation

## Name some key differences between a Syntax Error and a Logic Error.

* Syntax errors occur when the code violates the rules of the programming language, such as missing a semicolon or using the wrong syntax for a command. These types of errors are usually easy to identify and correct.
* Logic errors, on the other hand, occur when the code does not produce the expected result.

## List a few types of errors that you have encountered in past lab assignments and explain how you were able to correct them.

* Syntax errors, such as missing semicolons or brackets, were corrected by carefully reviewing the code and making the necessary corrections.
* Logic errors, such as incorrect calculations or incorrect conditional statements, were corrected by reviewing the code and identifying where the problem was occurring, then making the necessary changes.
* Runtime errors, such as trying to use an undefined variable, were corrected by checking the code for typos or incorrect variable names.

## How will this topic continue to influence your long term goals?

* Understanding the difference between syntax errors and logic errors is an important aspect of debugging code. As a developer, the ability to identify and correct these types of errors quickly and efficiently will be essential in my work.

## How would you describe the JavaScript Debugger tool and how it works to someone just starting out in software development?
* The JavaScript Debugger tool is a built-in tool in most modern web browsers used for debugging JavaScript code. It allows developers to set breakpoints in their code, examine the values of variables at specific points in the code, and step through the code line by line to identify and fix errors.

## Define what a breakpoint is.
* A breakpoint is a point in a program's code where the program will pause execution, allowing developers to examine the state of the program at that point. In the context of debugging JavaScript, a breakpoint is set by the developer using the debugger tool, and the program will pause execution when it reaches that point in the code.

## What is the call stack?
* The call stack is a data structure used by JavaScript (and other programming languages) to keep track of the current point of execution in a program. Each time a function is called, a new entry is added to the call stack, and when a function returns, its entry is removed from the stack. This allows the program to keep track of where it is in the code and which functions are currently executing.
