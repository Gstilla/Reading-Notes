# The Comparison Operators
in JavaScript are used to compare the values of two operands and return a boolean value (true or false) based on the result of the comparison. The comparison can be between numerical, string, logical, or object values.

There are two types of comparison operators in JavaScript: equality comparison operators and relational comparison operators.

### The equality comparison operators are:

* (equal to): returns true if the operands are equal. This operator performs type conversion to make the comparison if the operands are of different types.
*  (not equal to): returns true if the operands are not equal. This operator performs type conversion to make the comparison if the operands are of different types.
The strict equality comparison operators are:

* (strict equal to): returns true if the operands are equal and of the same type. This operator does not perform type conversion.
* (strict not equal to): returns true if the operands are not equal or are of different types. This operator does not perform type conversion.
* 
### The relational comparison operators are:

* (greater than): returns true if the left operand is greater than the right operand.
* (greater than or equal to): returns true if the left operand is greater than or equal to the right operand.
* (less than): returns true if the left operand is less than the right operand.
* (less than or equal to): returns true if the left operand is less than or equal to the right operand.
It's important to note that when comparing strings, JavaScript uses standard lexicographical ordering, which means it compares the Unicode values of each character in the strings.
