## To create a basic link, we wrap text or other content inside what element?
* To create a basic link in HTML, we wrap text or other content inside an <a> element. The <a> element stands for "anchor" and is used to create hyperlinks to other web pages, files, or locations within the same page. 
  
 ## The href attribute contains what information?
* The href attribute in an <a> element contains the URL (Uniform Resource Locator) or web address of the target location that the link should go to when clicked. This can be an external website, a different page on the same website, or a specific section of the same page (using an anchor tag).
  
  ## What are some ways we can ensure links on our pages are accessible to all readers?
### To ensure that links on our pages are accessible to all readers, we can follow some best practices such as:

* Using clear and descriptive link text that accurately describes the target of the link
* Avoiding the use of non-specific link text like "click here" or "read more"
* Making sure that links are distinguishable from surrounding text by using different colors, underlining, or other visual cues
* Providing additional context for links that may not be clear on their own, such as by using aria-labels or title attributes
* Testing our pages using accessibility tools like screen readers to ensure that all links are accessible to users with disabilities

  
  ## What is meant by “normal flow”?
* In CSS, "normal flow" refers to the default positioning and layout behavior of HTML elements on a web page. Elements are arranged in the order they appear in the HTML markup, with each element taking up the full width of its container (unless otherwise specified) and starting on a new line.
  
  ## What are a few differences between block-level and inline elements?
  
### Block-level elements are typically used to create larger sections of content on a web page, while inline elements are used to apply formatting and styles to smaller pieces of content. Some key differences between the two include:

* Block-level elements take up the full width of their container, while inline elements only take up the width of their content.
* Block-level elements always start on a new line, while inline elements can be placed within a line of text.
* Block-level elements can have margins and padding applied to them, while inline elements cannot.
  
 ##  ___ positioning is the default for every html element.
  
* "Static" positioning is the default for every HTML element. This means that elements are positioned according to their place in the normal flow of the document, as described above.
  
  
  
  ## Name a few advantages to using absolute positioning on an element.
### Some advantages of using absolute positioning on an element include:

* The ability to precisely position an element anywhere on the page, regardless of its place in the normal flow of the document.
* The ability to layer elements on top of each other using the z-index property, which can create interesting visual effects and layouts.
* The ability to create responsive designs that adapt to different screen sizes by positioning elements relative to their container or the viewport.
  
  ## What is a key difference between fixed positioning and absolute positioning?
* A key difference between fixed positioning and absolute positioning is that fixed positioning positions an element relative to the viewport, while absolute positioning positions an element relative to its nearest positioned ancestor element. This means that a fixed-position element will stay in the same place on the screen even as the user scrolls, while an absolutely positioned element will move with its nearest ancestor element.
  
  ## Describe the difference between a function declaration and a function invocation.
* A function declaration in JavaScript is a statement that defines a named function and its associated code block. It specifies the name of the function, any parameters it accepts, and the code that should be executed when the function is called.
  
  * A function invocation, on the other hand, is the actual call to a function, using the function name and any arguments it requires.
  
  ## What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?
  
* In JavaScript, a parameter is a named variable listed in a function's definition, which represents a value that the function expects to receive when it is called. Parameters are defined in the function declaration and are used to pass values into the function's code block. 
  * An argument, on the other hand, is the actual value that is passed to a function when it is called. Arguments are passed into the function when it is invoked, and are assigned to the corresponding parameters in the function's code block
  
  ## Pick 2 benefits to pair programming and reflect on how these benefits could help you on your coding journey.
  working in pairs gives you more leeway to focus on more specific parts of the project yeilding a more productivity and a overall better looking/functioning website.Working in pairs also splits the work load in half.
