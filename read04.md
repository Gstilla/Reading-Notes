# Read 04 Notes

## To create a basic link, we wrap text or other content inside what element?
* To create a basic link in HTML, we wrap text or other content inside an <a> element. The <a> element stands for "anchor" and is used to create hyperlinks to other web pages, files, or locations within the same page. 
  
 ## The href attribute contains what information?
* The href attribute in an <a> element contains the URL (Uniform Resource Locator) or web address of the target location that the link should go to when clicked. This can be an external website, a different page on the same website, or a specific section of the same page (using an anchor tag).
  
  ## What are some ways we can ensure links on our pages are accessible to all readers?
### To ensure that links on our pages are accessible to all readers, we can follow some best practices such as:

* Using clear and descriptive link text that accurately describes the target of the link
* Avoiding the use of non-specific link text like "click here" or "read more"
* Making sure that links are distinguishable from surrounding text by using different colors, underlining, or other visual cues
* Providing additional context for links that may not be clear on their own, such as by using aria-labels or title attributes
* Testing our pages using accessibility tools like screen readers to ensure that all links are accessible to users with disabilities
